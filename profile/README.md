# HiveMind Insiders

Welcome to HiveMind Insiders! In this github organization you will get exclusive access to [OpenVoiceOS](https://github.com/orgs/OpenVoiceOS) and [HiveMind](https://github.com/orgs/JarbasHiveMind) features

You can directly support me, Casimiro Ferreira (@JarbasAl) via [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/jarbasAI) or [paypal](https://paypal.me/AnaIsabelFerreira), besides ensuring the future of OpenVoiceOS and HiveMind by allowing me to work on those projects you will get:

- 100% transparent development, from the first commit
- early access to new OVOS/Hivemind technologies, possibly for years before they become public
- direct support via github issues or matrix chat private messages
- [suggest and vote](https://github.com/HiveMindInsiders/feature-requests) on which feature gets developed next
- get an invite to HiveMindInsider private matrix chatroom

## Current Goal

> **A small step** - get 10 sponsors or 500€ in donations

The terms of this sponsorware model are still being defined, you can read the initial idea [here](https://github.com/HiveMindInsiders/.github/blob/main/sponsorware.md)

The current goal is not only to evaluate the viability of this approach but also to involve the community from the start, together we can decide the next steps

> for the foreseable future there is no minimum donation amount, pay what you want!

once we reach 10 sponsors or receive 500€ in donations the following repositories will be made public:

> currently getting access is a manual process, please ping me if you are interested in getting access to HiveMind Insiders jarbasai@mailfence.com

Please understand that I may not answer questions in the public chat channels, specially in an "acceptable" timeframe. the community is super helpful and should step in, but if you expect timely support from the lead developer consider supporting me directly
