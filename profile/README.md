# HiveMind Insiders

Welcome to HiveMind Insiders! In this github organization you will get exclusive access to [OpenVoiceOS](https://github.com/orgs/OpenVoiceOS) and [HiveMind](https://github.com/orgs/JarbasHiveMind) features

You can directly support me, Casimiro Ferreira (@JarbasAl) via [liberapay](https://liberapay.com/jarbasAI) or [paypal](https://paypal.me/AnaIsabelFerreira), besides ensuring the future of OpenVoiceOS and HiveMind by allowing me to work on those projects you will get:

- 100% transparent development, from the first commit
- early access to new OVOS/Hivemind technologies, possibly for years before they become public
- direct support via github issues or matrix chat private messages
- [suggest and vote](https://github.com/HiveMindInsiders/feature-requests) on which feature gets developed next


## Current Goal

> **A small step** - get 10 sponsors

The terms of this sponsorware model are still being defined, you can read the initial idea [here](https://github.com/HiveMindInsiders/.github/blob/main/sponsorware.md)

The current goal is not only to evaluate the viability of this approach but also to involve the community from the start, together we can decide the next steps

> for the foreseable future there is no minimum donation amount, pay what you want!

what's already waiting for you [behind the curtain]https://github.com/orgs/HiveMindInsiders/discussions)?

> currently getting access is a manual process, please ping me if you are interested in getting access to HiveMind Insiders jarbasai@mailfence.com

Please understand that I may not answer questions in the public chat channels, specially in an "acceptable" timeframe. the community is super helpful and should step in, but if you expect timely support from the lead developer consider supporting me directly
