## 🎯 Current Goal

> **A small step**: Reach **10 sponsors** or **500 €** in donations

This is the first test of our sponsorware model. Read more about the philosophy behind it [here](https://github.com/HiveMindInsiders/.github/blob/main/sponsorware.md).

This goal will help evaluate the sustainability of this model, with **you** — the community — helping to decide where we go next.

> 💡 For now, there is **no minimum donation** — pay what you want!
